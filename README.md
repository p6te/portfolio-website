## Portfolio - personal website

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! ðŸ‘‹

## About

This repository houses the codebase for my personal website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences as a frontend developer. The site is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a fast and efficient development experience, with the added beauty of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for delightful animations.
